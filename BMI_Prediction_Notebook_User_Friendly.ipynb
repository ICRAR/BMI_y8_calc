    "# Year 8 BMI Prediction Calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Year 8 BMI Prediction Calculator! This tool helps you predict a child's Body Mass Index (BMI) at Year 8 based on measurements and factors from earlier years.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is BMI?\n",
    "\n",
    "Body Mass Index (BMI) is a value calculated from a person's weight and height. It provides a simple numeric measure of a person's thickness or thinness, allowing health professionals to discuss weight problems more objectively with their patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use This Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "This calculator is designed to be simple to use, even if you have no experience with programming. Just follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Select a Prediction Mode**: Choose between Simple Mode (10 variables) or Comprehensive Mode (20 variables)\n",
    "2. **Choose a Prediction Method**: Select either Single Sample (for one child) or Batch Processing (for multiple children)\n",
    "3. **Enter the Required Information**: Fill in the requested measurements and information\n",
    "4. **Get Your Prediction**: Click the \"Predict BMI\" button to see the results\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!"
